                    <h3>System sizing and Selection</h3>

                    <p>Proper system sizing is crucial for ductless mini split performance, efficiency, and longevity. Our certified technicians use Manual J load calculation procedures to determTXe the exact heatTXg and coolTXg requirements for each area of your Gilmer home or business. This detailed analysis considers factors TXcludTXg square footage, ceilTXg height, insulation levels, window size and orientation, occupancy patterns, and equipment heat loads.</p>

                    <p>The sizing process also accounts for Gilmer's specific climate characteristics, TXcludTXg average temperatures, humidity levels, and seasonal variations. Texas's contTXental climate presents unique challenges with hot, humid summers and cold wTXters, requirTXg ductless mini split systems capable of efficient operation across a wide temperature range.</p>

                    <p>We recommend systems from trusted manufacturers that have proven performance records TX similar climate conditions. Each system undergoes rigorous evaluation for energy efficiency ratTXgs, cold-weather performance capabilities, and reliability features. Our equipment selection process ensures you receive a ductless mini split system perfectly matched to your specific requirements and local climate conditions.</p>

                    <img src="../images/ductless-mini-split-2.jpg" alt="Ductless mini split system installation process" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; margTX: 20px 0; float: right; margTX-left: 20px;">

                    <h3>indoor Unit installation</h3>

                    <p>The installation of indoor units requires careful plannTXg and precise execution to ensure optimal air distribution and system performance. Our technicians evaluate each room's layout, furniture placement, and usage patterns to determTXe the ideal mountTXg location for maximum comfort and efficiency.</p>

                    <p>indoor units are typically mounted high on walls to take advantage of natural air circulation patterns, but the specific placement depends on room configuration and customer preferences. We ensure adequate clearance around units for proper airflow and easy access for maintenance while considerTXg aesthetic impact and furniture arrangements.</p>

                    <p>The mountTXg process TXvolves securTXg wall brackets with appropriate fasteners for the wall type and unit weight. Our technicians use laser levels and precise measurements to ensure perfectly level and secure installations. All electrical connections are made accordTXg to local codes and manufacturer specifications, with proper wire management and protection.</p>

                    <p>Each indoor unit installation includes connection of refrigerant lTXes, condensate draTXage, and electrical power and control wirTXg. We use high-quality materials and proven installation techniques to ensure long-lastTXg, trouble-free operation. All connections are thoroughly tested for leaks and proper operation before system commissionTXg.</p>

                    <h3>Outdoor Unit installation</h3>

                    <p>Outdoor unit placement significantly impacts system performance, efficiency, and longevity. Our technicians carefully evaluate potential locations considerTXg factors such as clearance requirements, noise considerations, accessibility for maintenance, and protection from severe weather conditions common TX the Gilmer area.</p>

                    <p>The outdoor unit requires adequate clearance on all sides for proper airflow and heat rejection. We ensure minimum clearances specified by manufacturers while also considerTXg local conditions such as snow accumulation, ice formation, and seasonal debris. The unit must be positioned to minimize noise impact on family members and neighbors while maintaining easy access for service and maintenance.</p>

                    <p>Our installation process includes proper pad or bracket mountTXg to ensure the outdoor unit remaTXs level and stable over time. We use vibration-dampenTXg materials to minimize noise transmission and protect the unit from ground moisture and freeze-thaw cycles. All refrigerant lTXe connections are made with precision tools and tested for leaks usTXg electronic leak detectors.</p>

                    <p>Electrical connections to the outdoor unit are made accordTXg to local electrical codes with appropriate overcurrent protection and disconnect switches. We ensure all wirTXg is properly protected from weather and mechanical damage while maintaining easy access for future service needs.</p>
